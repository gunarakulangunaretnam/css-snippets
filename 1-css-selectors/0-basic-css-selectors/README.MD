# Basic CSS Selectors


## Element Selectors


```css

h1 {
    color: red;
   }

```


## Example:

This is a paragraph that contains several span tags. I'd like to style these span tags across my entire site at once, to establish a default site-wide format for them. The most efficient selector for this would be the element selector, as it will allow me to establish a base-line format for the span tag with a low degree of specificity. This means that the formatting will be controlled throughout the entire site with a single selector, and it will be easy to overwrite in specific instances where I want the styling to change.
